The **goal** is to develop a web application for doctors to consult patients.

##### Technologies used:
* For front end website: **Asp.net MVC Razor, Jquery (Javascript ES6), DOM, Html5, Bootstrap version 4 ( css3 ).** 
* For website backend: **c# asp.net MVC**
* For Reports: **Crystal Reports, syncfusion components Web (syncfusion components) https://www.syncfusion.com/.**
* For Database: **MS SQL SERVER , T-SQL (views, store procedure, functions)**
* For components like calendar, date, inputs, etc.: **syncfusion components Web (syncfusion components).**
* For version control: **Git (BitBucket, SourceTree / Atlassian)(https://michaeljav@bitbucket.org/michaeljav/doctormedicalweb/downloads/)**
Web Server: **Internet Information Services (IIS) for Windows Server**


##### I developed pages in three categories:
**Windows for maintenance (these are windows where doctors enter the basic information that will be repeated among several patients when consulting them):** Diagnoses, Physical Evaluation, Images, Insurance Institutions, Procedures, Medications, reasons for consultation, etc.

**Windows for processes (These are the windows where the doctors enter the consultation data for each patient):** Consultation, Patient, Prescription, Appointment or Agenda, Billing, etc.

**configuration windows (These are the windows where the doctors configure the administration of the system such as the number of offices it will have, work hours, etc.):** Doctors, Offices, Clinics, Staff Category, Work Hours, etc.

The doctors are able to carry out their consultations more agilely. Previously, the secretary had to search for the clinical history of each patient every time that patient came to the consultation since with the system it was not necessary. Doctors could view their appointments more quickly, they also reduced the use of paper, and patient information was more organized and easier to find.
